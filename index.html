            <p>Fria Kahlo was a Mexican painter known for her many portraits, self-portraits, and works inspired by the nature and artifacts of Mexico. She started painting after being impaled in a bus accident at age 18. Kahlo later became politically active and married fellow communist artist Diego Rivera. She’s admired today as a feminist icon.</p>
